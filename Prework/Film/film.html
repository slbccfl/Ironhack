		<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_(film)">Unbreakable</a></h1>
		<p>A man learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident.</p>
		<h2>Storyline</h2>
		<p>This suspense thriller unfolds as the audience is introduced to David Dunn. Not only is he the <em>sole survivor</em> of a horrific train-crash that killed 131 people <em>he doesn't have a scratch on him</em>. Elijah Price is an obscure character who approaches Dunn with a seemingly far fetched theory behind it all</p>
		<h3>Steve's Review</h3>
		<p>I've seen this movie several times, and I have feel it is a classic. It takes a sophisticated approach to the mythos of comic book stores. The movie brings the fantasy of the comic-book world and offers the idea that perhaps there is a element of reality in them.</p>
